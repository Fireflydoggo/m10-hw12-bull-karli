Only one issue that kept popping up, the test under car class
"should have "performMaintenance" method that logs "maintenance complete" after 3 seconds"
would not pass, no matter where I placed the code, however, it shows 100% with all the code in place.
I went over both your lecture videos and searched through the Module 10 files and w3schools, and I can't seem to figure out why it will only pass for Pontiac but not the generic Car Class.
